    <p class = "biryani_content">
        <strong>Hyderabadi birayni recipe</strong> - Making a good <strong>hyderabadi biryani</strong> is very simple
        and this recipe is perfect for a home preparation. This is the easiest <strong>biryani</strong> since it needs
        no sauteing of spies or meat. Just marinate the meat with the spices & other ingredients. Layer partially
        cooked basmati rice over it. Cook on a slow dun process, trapping the steam to retain
        the aroma.
    </p>

        To get an authentic flavor and taste of <span class = 'span_edits'>biryani</span>, do use all the mentioned
        ingredients and if desired you can substitue ghee for oil.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is one of the <span class = 'span_edits'>best hyderabadi biryani recipe</span> I have made for years and has been
        a favorite among the readers of this blog. It is very easy and even a beginner can try without
        any troubles.
        <br>
        <br>

        This is a kacchi hyderabadi biryani, meaning partially cooked rice is layered over the
        marinated raw meat.
        <br>
        <br>
        To make the best out of this recipe, chicken needs a proper marination which mainly helps to
        tenderize it, resulting in juicy, flavorful, soft and tender chicken.
        <br>
        <br>

        It can be marinated the previous night and refrigerated to make the best flavorful biryani.
        <br>

        You can serve hyderabadi biryani with any of these <span> raitas</span> I have shared earlier.
        Even lassi goes well in the meal.
